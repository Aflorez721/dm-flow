This repository contains example diagrams and materials for using 
SAS Enterprise Miner to perform data mining.

The repository includes XML files (which represent SAS Enterprise Miner 
process flow diagrams) for association analysis, clustering, credit scoring, 
predictive modeling, survival analysis, text mining, time series, and 
accompanying PDF files to help guide you through the process flow diagrams.

These examples were tested in the following environment:

Windows Server 2008 R2 Enterprise

Dual Intel Xeon E5-2667 @ 2.9 GHz

128 GB RAM 

SAS 9.4 (TS1M2)

SAS Enterprise Miner 13.2

===============

Download (and unzip) or clone this repository. The repository contains one 
directory for each data mining topic (clustering, survival analysis, and 
so on). Each directory contains one or more example XML files (diagrams) 
and associated PDF documentation. 

To run these examples:

1) Create a new Project in SAS Enterprise Miner. 

2) Right-click on the Diagrams folder in the top left corner, and select 
"Import Diagram from XML." Select the XML file from one of the directories,
and open the corresponding PDF document to learn about the technique
implemented in the example.

NOTE: You can import multiple XML files into the same SAS Enterprise Miner
project or you can choose to create a separate project for every topic.

3) Right-click on the last node and select "Run" to run the process flow
diagram.
